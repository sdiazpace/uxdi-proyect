                    I’ve noticed a trend after screening dozens of junior designer portfolios. Designers (mostly from bootcamps) were heavily
                    focused on UX and evangelizing the Design Thinking mindset popularized by consultancies like IDEO. What
                    lacked was the ability to breath life into designs, and portfolios fell flat in showcasing visual design
                    fundamentals taught in art school.

                    in front the screen. I slept — a bit — ate and I also took a shower. That is it. A good 30 hours pressing
                    buttons on the controller and grinding my teeth.

                    Bias is everywhere in society, it is inscribed in our very own behaviors. Our biases are unconscious and we enact them without
                    intent to harm others or affect our relationships, yet they do, and in fact they frame and constrain
                    all interactions in society. They are the reason women are paid less than men for the same work, the
                    reason why journalists present the information their audience wants to hear and how guesses are presented
                    as facts in headlines.

                    It’s easy to come up with a hundred names for your product, but how do you pick the right one? Most naming guides attribute
                    the decision making process to instinct or a loose framework. However a key component tends to be missing
                    from the process — user or customer validation.
